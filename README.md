This is a simple Python program that lets users encrypt and decrypt messages using Caesar and Vigenère ciphers.

Originally built in 2022 for my AP Computer Science Principles class in high school, this project was my introduction to classical encryption in Python.

Vigenère cipher with keyword support

Handles letters, punctuation, and numbers

Clean CLI interface with input validation
